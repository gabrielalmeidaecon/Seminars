    "description": "Can Environmental Markets Solve the Biodiversity Crisis?\nwith James Blume\nAbstract:\nWe examine whether environmental markets – designed to achieve environmental goals in a flexible and economically-efficient manner – are effective at protecting biodiversity. We first develop a parsimonious model that uncovers how markets for quotas foster private economies of scale, which can however be associated with social diseconomies of scale. We test this central prediction in the context of commercial fishing, one of the main source of biodiversity depletion. We leverage stable national fishing quota shares in the Northern Atlantic Fishery combined with the staggered introduction of national markets for these quotas by three European countries as a source of exogenous variation in the exposure of fish populations to markets. We find that the adoption of environmental markets results in an overall decrease in both fish populations and annual fish landings. These effects are especially pronounced for species that are less commercially valuable, and more exposed to large scale extraction techniques. Environmental markets reshape the production function for the main natural resource by concentrating production among agents targeting this resource with large-scale assets, thereby exacerbating negative externalities on other parts of the ecosystem.",

However, due to recent public and regulatory demands for extended transparency, disclosure interferes with supplier contracting. We highlight interaction effects resulting from sharing demand information with potential suppliers and extended financial disclosure. Our model is a two stage game in which supplier contracting, modeled as an information design game, precedes voluntary capital market disclosure. Sharing information in either of the two stages comes with externalities for the other. Demand information provided to suppliers leaks into the disclosure stage, as information shared once cannot be taken back. Capital market disclosure feeds back into the suppliers’ renegotiation decision, as it reveals proprietary bargaining information. We identify conditions under which extended capital market disclosure favors a supplier. We find that the buyer avoids contract renegotiation by withholding certain capital market information.",

We find that CV adoption more than doubles Hispanic representation within five years, increasing Hispanic board share by roughly four percentage points from a low pre-period mean and raising the probability that a district has at least one Hispanic board member. Effects are larger where Hispanic population shares are higher and are not concentrated in more educated districts, suggesting that coordination constraints are not the primary barrier.
