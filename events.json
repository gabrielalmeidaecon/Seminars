    "description": "Can Environmental Markets Solve the Biodiversity Crisis?\nwith James Blume\nAbstract:\nWe examine whether environmental markets – designed to achieve environmental goals in a flexible and economically-efficient manner – are effective at protecting biodiversity. We first develop a parsimonious model that uncovers how markets for quotas foster private economies of scale, which can however be associated with social diseconomies of scale. We test this central prediction in the context of commercial fishing, one of the main source of biodiversity depletion. We leverage stable national fishing quota shares in the Northern Atlantic Fishery combined with the staggered introduction of national markets for these quotas by three European countries as a source of exogenous variation in the exposure of fish populations to markets. We find that the adoption of environmental markets results in an overall decrease in both fish populations and annual fish landings. These effects are especially pronounced for species that are less commercially valuable, and more exposed to large scale extraction techniques. Environmental markets reshape the production function for the main natural resource by concentrating production among agents targeting this resource with large-scale assets, thereby exacerbating negative externalities on other parts of the ecosystem.",

Our model is a two stage game in which supplier contracting, modeled as an information design game, precedes voluntary capital market disclosure. Sharing information in either of the two stages comes with externalities for the other. Demand information provided to suppliers leaks into the disclosure stage, as information shared once cannot be taken back.

We develop a model of the equity term structure in which unexpected policy tightening signals inflation concerns, raising both investor inflation expectations and the risk premia of short-term assets. Using high-frequency dividend strip data around FOMC announcements, we document a regime change between the pre-COVID period (2004-2020) and the post-COVID period (2021-2025). Before COVID, short-term equity responds positively to monetary policy surprises and predicts near-term dividend growth, but not inflation - consistent with growth information effects documented in prior work. After COVID, these patterns reverse - as predicted by our model: short-term equity loads negatively on monetary policy surprises and predicts near-term inflation but not dividend growth. Predictability is concentrated in the reaction to the target rate announcement rather than the press conference that follows, suggesting that investors extract inflation signals from the Fed's actions rather than its words. Our findings indicate that the content of Fed Information effects is regime-dependent, shifting from growth to inflation as macroeconomic uncertainty evolves.",

This paper challenges this notion and introduces the ''Virtue of Transaction Costs''. Using a flexible ''predict-then-optimise'' framework that disentangles return forecasting from portfolio selection, I implement a ''double regularisation'' strategy: Standard ML algorithms provide first-stage shrinkage on return predictions, while the portfolio optimisation uses TC as a second-stage, stock-specific Ridge regularisation on active trades. Testing this in a challenging setting (trading post 2004, long-only and restricted to active S&P500 members in each trading month), I find that acting as if TC are large strictly improves performance. Moreover, regularisation through TC outperforms vanilla Ridge regularisation. My results demonstrate that ML algorithms consistently outperform the S&P 500 fully out-of-sample and are therefore able to extract genuine alpha rather than merely exploiting hard-to-arbitrage frictions.",

Across various transmitter incentive schemes, a claim’s reliability is lost in transmission more than twice as much as the claim itself. Reliable and unreliable information, once filtered through transmission, impact listener beliefs similarly, substantially reducing the efficiency of downstream decisions. Mechanism experiments show that reliability is lost not because it is perceived as less relevant or harder to transmit, but because it is less likely to come to mind during transmission.
