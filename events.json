    "description": "Inflation and Floating-Rate Loans: Evidence from the Euro-Area\nwith Fabrizio Core, Filippo De Marco, Tim Eisert\nAbstract:\nWe provide novel evidence on the supply-side transmission of monetary policy through a floating-rate channel. After a rate hike, firms with floating-rate loans keep prices elevated to offset higher borrowing costs, thereby reducing the effectiveness of monetary policy. Using monthly data on product-level prices, industry-level inflation rates and the euro-area credit register from 2021 to 2023, we find that the short-run impact of monetary tightening on inflation is 50% smaller when firms rely on floating-rate loans. This effect is stronger for firms that rely more on working capital to finance production and when they can easily pass on higher prices to their sticky customer base (customer capital). To address the selection of firms into floating-rate loans, we exploit bank-side factors in the lending relationship. Firms more exposed to floating-rate loans increase their mark-ups more during the rate tightening, but also see higher funding costs. Overall, if firms across the euro area had a lower reliance on floating-rate loans, inflation would have been 0.8 percentage points lower in 2022-2023.\nPaper",

Using German social-security linked employer–employee data, I first document that migrants and locals follow systematically different career paths: migrants accumulate more but shorter full-time spells, reach lower positions in the wage distribution, and display higher early exit hazards and lower promotion rates along job ladders than locals. To interpret these patterns, I develop a dynamic career model with Bayesian learning about worker ability, assignment along a job ladder, and search frictions. The model implies a double-threshold rule in posterior beliefs: when beliefs fall below a lower threshold, workers exit. Between lower and upper thresholds they remain and wait for further information. Above the upper threshold they are promoted. These thresholds are endogenous and move over the career. Using within worker changes in assignments and wage residuals, I estimate the learning technology by GMM. Preliminary results indicate that migrants face systematically noisier performance signals than locals, especially on lower rungs of the ladder. Ongoing work embeds these estimates into the full dynamic model and studies the implications for retention, promotion, and the “foreign glass ceiling”.",

We find financial stability risks are U-shaped in mortgage fixation length. While FRMs benefit from deposit rate stickiness, ARMs provide net worth hedging by concentrating defaults in states when intermediary net worth is high due to increases in mortgage income. An intermediate fixation length balances these effects, minimizing financial sector volatility and improving aggregate risk sharing.</p>\n<p><a class=\"download\" href=\"fileadmin/user_upload/dateien_abteilungen/abt_fin/Dokumente/PDFs/Finance_Seminar_Papers/ElenevLiu.pdf\" title=\"Initiates file download\">Paper</a></p>",

    "description": "Title:\nChanging Jobs to Fight Inflation: Labor Market Reactions to Inflationary Shocks (with Koru, O. and Villalvazo S.)\nAbstract:\nWe argue that inflationary shocks affect allocative efficiency by changing the rate and the characteristics of workers' job-to-job transitions. First, using monetary policy shocks and survey data on search effort, we empirically show that a one percentage point rise in inflation increases job-to-job transitions by up to 4.5%, and workers with higher inflation expectations are more likely to search and do so more effectively. Second, we build a general equilibrium model of directed on-the-job search to quantify the aggregate implications of labor market reactions. Higher-than-expected inflation reduces real wages, prompting workers to search more actively and aim lower. This increases job-to-job transitions but lowers the efficiency gains per transition. Therefore, the effect on output is ambiguous. Last, we calibrate the model to the U.S. economy. Inflationary shocks increase reallocation rates, yet allocative efficiency and output decline. Small deflationary shocks (e.g., 2%) increase output in the short run, while others decrease it.",

    "description": "Title:\nGender Differences in the Response to Incentives: Evidence from Academia\nAbstract:\nKnowledge work and other high-skilled jobs commonly feature both explicit performance incentives and market-based career-concern incentives. Gender differences in mobility, negotiation attitudes, and performance assessments could cause women to respond less to career-concern incentives. This could have implications for gender gaps in performance, pay and female representation, as well as innovation and knowledge creation. This paper studies whether men and women respond to different types of incentives, and how this affects knowledge output and female representation. Exploiting the introduction of performance pay in German academia as a natural experiment and using a data set that encompasses the affiliations and publication records of the universe of German academics, I provide evidence of gender differences in the causal response to explicit performance incentives and career-concern incentives. I find that men have a significant effort response to career-concern incentives only, of 16% to 19%, while women have a significant effort response to explicit performance incentives only, of 36% to 40%. This dichotomous response to incentives has implications for innovation and female representation. While women increase work that ends up being most highly cited in response to performance pay, men do not. Men do increase work that is more novel, but which has only medium impact. Women increase work that is less novel, but which garners more follow-on research. I find that there is positive self-selection of both men and women into performance pay. But I also find suggestive evidence that more productive women may not be more likely to receive academic job offers – despite their positive, high(er) quality effort response. This could limit female representation in academia and may negatively impact innovation.",
