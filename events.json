We study the general equilibrium effects of mortgage lock-in on housing markets and evaluate a policy aimed at unlocking lock-in. We provide evidence that lock-in increases prices relative to a counterfactual where rates reset, particularly in expensive areas, because locked-in borrowers would otherwise have downsized and demanded less housing. We design a spatial housing ladder model with long-term mortgages, generating a distribution of locked-in rates and equilibrium effects on mobility and prices consistent with the data. A temporary rate hike causes lock-in, increasing housing demand and prices relative to a counterfactual without lock-in, especially in expensive areas. A $10k tax credit to starter-home sellers modestly unlocks mobility while increasing trade-up home prices, with the vast majority of transfer recipients being infra-marginal.\nPaper",

I exploit (i) a 2001 Supreme Court ruling that opened a pathway to state-court enforcement of commercial contracts and (ii) the staggered adoption of tribal secured transactions laws (STLs) between 1985 and 2016, which allow movable assets to be pledged as collateral. Using difference-in-differences, I find that reducing enforcement risk via the 2001 ruling increases small-business loan size by 10% where STLs preexisted. STL adoption raises loan size by 11%, with no effect before 2001. STL effects are largest under uniform codes with centralized registries, and gains are disproportionately concentrated in ex ante wealthier reservations. STLs raise wage per worker and income per capita but not total employment. Instead, employment reallocates toward movable-asset-intensive sectors. These results provide micro evidence on the finance–growth link: complementarities between collateral law and enforcement shape how finance affects growth and who benefits across jurisdictions, sectors, and legal designs.",

Using German social-security linked employer–employee data, I first document that migrants and locals follow systematically different career paths: migrants accumulate more but shorter full-time spells, reach lower positions in the wage distribution, and display higher early exit hazards and lower promotion rates along job ladders than locals. To interpret these patterns, I develop a dynamic career model with Bayesian learning about worker ability, assignment along a job ladder, and search frictions. The model implies a double-threshold rule in posterior beliefs: when beliefs fall below a lower threshold, workers exit. Between lower and upper thresholds they remain and wait for further information. Above the upper threshold they are promoted. These thresholds are endogenous and move over the career. Using within worker changes in assignments and wage residuals, I estimate the learning technology by GMM. Preliminary results indicate that migrants face systematically noisier performance signals than locals, especially on lower rungs of the ladder. Ongoing work embeds these estimates into the full dynamic model and studies the implications for retention, promotion, and the “foreign glass ceiling”.",
