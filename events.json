Unlike traditional deposits, internal loans serve as asset‐like liabilities that offer banks a stable funding alternative. Our results show that banks with access to internal funding engage more aggressively in the syndicated lending market, originating larger loans with longer maturities and lower spreads while expanding relationships with new, marginal — often financially constrained — borrowers. Although these bank subsidiaries exhibit higher non‐performing loan ratios, the aggregate impact of internal loans on performance is positive. We also show how internal capital allocation decisions differ between bank and nonbank subsidiaries, with nonbanks receiving increasingly preferential treatment over time. Our findings underscore the critical importance of internal capital markets in shaping bank behavior and influencing credit access in the economy while undermining the transmission of monetary policy.\nPaper",

    "description": "Biased Promotions\nJoint with Daniel Ferreira and Radoslawa Nikolowa\nAbstract:\nWe present a model of biased promotions in which firm size, wages, and internal labor markets are endogenously determined in a competitive labor market equilibrium. Workers value both wages and job amenities, and differ only by a non-productive label: “Blue” or “Red.” Firms favor the Blue group in promotions. The equilibrium features partial segregation: large, high-wage firms employ workers from both groups and offer biased promotion opportunities, while small, low-wage firms hire only workers from the unfavored group and offer stable careers. Although individual firms prefer unbiased promotions, biased promotions collectively benefit firms by weakening worker bargaining power. The model endogenizes firm heterogeneity and helps explain why bias-driven gaps in promotions and earnings may persist even in competitive markets.\nPaper",

The reform we investigate lowered the age of legal adulthood from 21 to 18 in 1975 West Germany. Before the reform, academic-track students became legal adults 1-2 years after obtaining university entrance qualification (Abitur), and thus needed formal parent consent to enroll in university. As a consequence of the reform, students became legal adults before obtaining university entrance qualification. Our difference-in-differences model exploits variation in school start cutoff dates that vary between federal states. Holding constant federal state and month of birth, we define treatment status as being legal adult at the predicted time of receiving a university entry degree. Using data from the German Microcensus, we show that women reaching legal adulthood before finishing secondary school are more likely to obtain a postsecondary degree, which is driven by university degrees. On the other side, treated women are less likely to marry and have children. Conditional on being married and cohabitating with their partner, they are more likely to have a partner with a university degree as opposed to having a partner with a vocational degree. Reaching the age of majority earlier thus has lasting effects on major life events and the population composition as a whole.",

    "description": "Inflation and Floating-Rate Loans: Evidence from the Euro-Area\nwith Fabrizio Core, Filippo De Marco, Tim Eisert\nAbstract:\nWe provide novel evidence on the supply-side transmission of monetary policy through a floating-rate channel. After a rate hike, firms with floating-rate loans keep prices elevated to offset higher borrowing costs, thereby reducing the effectiveness of monetary policy. Using monthly data on product-level prices, industry-level inflation rates and the euro-area credit register from 2021 to 2023, we find that the short-run impact of monetary tightening on inflation is 50% smaller when firms rely on floating-rate loans. This effect is stronger for firms that rely more on working capital to finance production and when they can easily pass on higher prices to their sticky customer base (customer capital). To address the selection of firms into floating-rate loans, we exploit bank-side factors in the lending relationship. Firms more exposed to floating-rate loans increase their mark-ups more during the rate tightening, but also see higher funding costs. Overall, if firms across the euro area had a lower reliance on floating-rate loans, inflation would have been 0.8 percentage points lower in 2022-2023.\nPaper",

We study the general equilibrium effects of mortgage lock-in on housing markets and evaluate a policy aimed at unlocking lock-in. We provide evidence that lock-in increases prices relative to a counterfactual where rates reset, particularly in expensive areas, because locked-in borrowers would otherwise have downsized and demanded less housing. We design a spatial housing ladder model with long-term mortgages, generating a distribution of locked-in rates and equilibrium effects on mobility and prices consistent with the data. A temporary rate hike causes lock-in, increasing housing demand and prices relative to a counterfactual without lock-in, especially in expensive areas.

Using insights from the literature on equity issuance, we then conclude that the anomaly reflects persistent mispricing.

First, using monetary policy shocks and survey data on search effort, we empirically show that a one percentage point rise in inflation increases job-to-job transitions by up to 4.5%, and workers with higher inflation expectations are more likely to search and do so more effectively. Second, we build a general equilibrium model of directed on-the-job search to quantify the aggregate implications of labor market reactions. Higher-than-expected inflation reduces real wages, prompting workers to search more actively and aim lower. This increases job-to-job transitions but lowers the efficiency gains per transition. Therefore, the effect on output is ambiguous. Last, we calibrate the model to the U.S. economy. Inflationary shocks increase reallocation rates, yet allocative efficiency and output decline. Small deflationary shocks (e.g., 2%) increase output in the short run, while others decrease it.",
