However, due to recent public and regulatory demands for extended transparency, disclosure interferes with supplier contracting. We highlight interaction effects resulting from sharing demand information with potential suppliers and extended financial disclosure. Our model is a two stage game in which supplier contracting, modeled as an information design game, precedes voluntary capital market disclosure. Sharing information in either of the two stages comes with externalities for the other. Demand information provided to suppliers leaks into the disclosure stage, as information shared once cannot be taken back. Capital market disclosure feeds back into the suppliers’ renegotiation decision, as it reveals proprietary bargaining information. We identify conditions under which extended capital market disclosure favors a supplier. We find that the buyer avoids contract renegotiation by withholding certain capital market information.",

We develop a model of the equity term structure in which unexpected policy tightening signals inflation concerns, raising both investor inflation expectations and the risk premia of short-term assets. Using high-frequency dividend strip data around FOMC announcements, we document a regime change between the pre-COVID period (2004-2020) and the post-COVID period (2021-2025). Before COVID, short-term equity responds positively to monetary policy surprises and predicts near-term dividend growth, but not inflation - consistent with growth information effects documented in prior work. After COVID, these patterns reverse - as predicted by our model: short-term equity loads negatively on monetary policy surprises and predicts near-term inflation but not dividend growth. Predictability is concentrated in the reaction to the target rate announcement rather than the press conference that follows, suggesting that investors extract inflation signals from the Fed's actions rather than its words. Our findings indicate that the content of Fed Information effects is regime-dependent, shifting from growth to inflation as macroeconomic uncertainty evolves.",

Our identification leverages the fact that, in equilibrium models, asset prices are jump variables and reveal priced risks in large cross-sections of returns  (N → ∞).  We find that macro factors' risk premia are strongly time-varying and countercyclical, with sharply increasing unconditional term structures. This pattern is driven by the slow propagation of a priced common shock, distinct from TFP,  that captures most of the persistence in macroeconomic variables.  Macro risk premia are negligible in the short run, yet grow to match equity risk premia at the business cycle horizon. This finding is not a mechanical byproduct of persistence: while GDP, consumption, industrial production, and employment exhibit upward-sloping term structures, other similarly persistent factors, e.g., VIX or intermediary-based variables, display downward-sloping or flat ones.",
