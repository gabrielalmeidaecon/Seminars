    "description": "Rewiring Supply Chains Through Uncoordinated Climate Policy\nwith Emanuela Benincasa, Olimpia Carradori, Miguel Ferreira\nAbstract:\nWe show that climate transition risks can significantly disrupt supply chain networks. Specifically, suppliers affected by the California cap-and-trade program are more likely to lose customer relationships and less likely to form new ones compared to their peers unaffected by the program. The effects are more pronounced among suppliers facing high competitive pressure and producing standardized inputs. Additionally, affected suppliers experience declines in revenues, assets, and profitability. This supply chain rewiring induced by uncoordinated climate policies is consistent with carbon leakage, as customers exposed to the program through production networks show an increase in their supply chain emission intensity.\nPaper",

    "description": "Title:\nClimb or Exit: Career Progression and Outmigration\nAbstract:\nDo information frictions induce foreign workers to leave the host labor market earlier and climb more slowly? Using German social-security linked employer–employee data, I first document that migrants and locals follow systematically different career paths: migrants accumulate more but shorter full-time spells, reach lower positions in the wage distribution, and display higher early exit hazards and lower promotion rates along job ladders than locals. To interpret these patterns, I develop a dynamic career model with Bayesian learning about worker ability, assignment along a job ladder, and search frictions. The model implies a double-threshold rule in posterior beliefs: when beliefs fall below a lower threshold, workers exit. Between lower and upper thresholds they remain and wait for further information. Above the upper threshold they are promoted. These thresholds are endogenous and move over the career. Using within worker changes in assignments and wage residuals, I estimate the learning technology by GMM. Preliminary results indicate that migrants face systematically noisier performance signals than locals, especially on lower rungs of the ladder. Ongoing work embeds these estimates into the full dynamic model and studies the implications for retention, promotion, and the “foreign glass ceiling”.",

However, these preferences are often treated as stable, with heterogeneity assumed only between audiences rather than evolving within them. Our study aims to explain how preferences for atypicality might evolve among venture capitalists, using data on startups and their investments from PitchBook and Crunchbase. We distinguish between two complementary lenses: an experiential perspective, focusing on how prior investment experiences could shape subsequent choices, and a socially constructed perspective, focusing on how network exposure and field embeddedness may influence investment patterns. Our study suggests that VCs’ preferences for unconventional ventures may change over time, indicating that audience preferences are dynamic and context-dependent, rather than fixed markers of evaluation.",
