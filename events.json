Specifically, suppliers affected by the California cap-and-trade program are more likely to lose customer relationships and less likely to form new ones compared to their peers unaffected by the program. The effects are more pronounced among suppliers facing high competitive pressure and producing standardized inputs. Additionally, affected suppliers experience declines in revenues, assets, and profitability. This supply chain rewiring induced by uncoordinated climate policies is consistent with carbon leakage, as customers exposed to the program through production networks show an increase in their supply chain emission intensity.\nPaper",

    "description": "Can Environmental Markets Solve the Biodiversity Crisis?\nwith James Blume\nAbstract:\nWe examine whether environmental markets – designed to achieve environmental goals in a flexible and economically-efficient manner – are effective at protecting biodiversity. We first develop a parsimonious model that uncovers how markets for quotas foster private economies of scale, which can however be associated with social diseconomies of scale. We test this central prediction in the context of commercial fishing, one of the main source of biodiversity depletion. We leverage stable national fishing quota shares in the Northern Atlantic Fishery combined with the staggered introduction of national markets for these quotas by three European countries as a source of exogenous variation in the exposure of fish populations to markets. We find that the adoption of environmental markets results in an overall decrease in both fish populations and annual fish landings. These effects are especially pronounced for species that are less commercially valuable, and more exposed to large scale extraction techniques. Environmental markets reshape the production function for the main natural resource by concentrating production among agents targeting this resource with large-scale assets, thereby exacerbating negative externalities on other parts of the ecosystem.",

Using 691,083 bargaining interactions from eBay’s Best Offer platform, I predict negotiation success and final prices from ex-ante context and early offer sequences. I document a clear informational progression: uncertainty about agreement resolves early due to initial anchors and context, while uncertainty about final prices collapses only later as offers converge. Accordingly, agreement outcomes become predictable much earlier than prices. I establish a lower bound on predictability that exceeds theoretical and regression-based benchmarks, achieving up to 85.7% accuracy in success prediction and mean absolute errors as low as 0.026 for normalized prices. Prediction gains show diminishing returns to data and model complexity, indicating limits to learnable structure. These results quantify when and how bargaining outcomes are determined by observable behavior and impose empirical constraints on bargaining models.",

However, due to recent public and regulatory demands for extended transparency, disclosure interferes with supplier contracting. We highlight interaction effects resulting from sharing demand information with potential suppliers and extended financial disclosure. Our model is a two stage game in which supplier contracting, modeled as an information design game, precedes voluntary capital market disclosure. Sharing information in either of the two stages comes with externalities for the other. Demand information provided to suppliers leaks into the disclosure stage, as information shared once cannot be taken back. Capital market disclosure feeds back into the suppliers’ renegotiation decision, as it reveals proprietary bargaining information. We identify conditions under which extended capital market disclosure favors a supplier. We find that the buyer avoids contract renegotiation by withholding certain capital market information.",
